	// GitHub :- is Central Source code Management Tool. (Manage central Repository)
	// GitHub:-  it is a platform provide facility to centrally manage our code( Centrally repository we use).
	//            so we can perform actions like pull , push etc
	
	// we conect our loacl repository to central repository so that everyone can see it and they no need to ask everytime.
	// it just simply store your code centrally (central location) so that anyone from your team can get it easily

	// In company they provides us with central repository (on GitHub)
	// we have just simply go on that repository and pull push the code we wanted to work on.
	// in our system we create Local repository using (Git)
	
	
	
	
	

	
	// How to connect your loal repository with central repository:-  (This is from scratch ) this is not our work in company but you must have idea
	  
	/*   1) (git init)                 (create new local repository)
         2) (git status)               (shows whether any repository generated or not)	     
	     3) (git remote add origin)    //link of central repository paste here //we add remote location/storage
	     4) (git add .)                 this command adds all the files to the central repository    (dot (.) represents all )
	     
	      Note:- At the place of "main" you can give any name you want to your branch
	      
	     //You can directly use git commit here but sometimes system shows error => "unable to auto-detect email address"
	     // so add these two steps before commit
	     5)  git config --global user.email "rushikeshawari16@gmail.com"
         6)  git config --global user.name "rushiawari"
         
	     7) (git commit ) -m "This is first commit"   (always provide meaningfull massage with commit cammand) 
	     
	     8)  git push --set-upstream origin main    => by this step we push our code to the "main" branch
	     
	      // Now we can see our code/project in main branch of our GitHub repository
	      // There is option name "Code"  inside that there is link of this code that our lead provides us in company.
