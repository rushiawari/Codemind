	// How to take/Pull changes from your central repo to your local repo/IDE
	
	// When Ever any change happens in your project or any one from your team adds new code on central repo 
	// you need to pull that code/change to your workspace.(Local repo)
	
	// Then how will you Pull the code from central Repo:-
	
	/*
	 * 1) open your git bash 
	 * 2) git status => you will see if there any modification/addition happened in your project/code.
	 * 3) git pull   => it will immediatly retrive all the modifiaction code to youe local repo and you will be able to see that new code inside your workspace.
	 * or
	 * 3) git pull origin main/master => what ever your branch from which you are pulling the code
	 * 
	 *    we no need to provide path to pull because we are not uploading like push hence no need to select
	 *    All the changes will directly retrive when you git pull and enter.
	 *    In git pull => it also shows us what changes are done and which folder/file got modified.
	 * 
	 * 
	 *  Note:- commit command comes only in the case of Push
	 *         Whenever you try to push you need to commit first.
	 *         not needed in case of pull. 
	 * 
	 *

	// Most Imp Note :- When you pull All the changes that are happend in Central repo get automatically added in your local repository
	//                  it means you can not control pull ... it just pulls each and every change that have been made inside your central repository.
